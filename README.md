# annsjon-spa
Simple SPA for annsjon.org

## Background
The idea was to create a new website for [Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory](http://www.annsjon.org).
With a lot of static content and text heavy pages I wanted to build something fast and lightweight, simple and easy to update. Yet using technologies that supports modern development and scalability.

## Technologies
- Node.js
- Webpack (transpiling and bundling)
- Riot (templating and routing)
- Markdown (page articles)
- LESS (BEM standard)
- Skeleton (RWD boilerplate)
