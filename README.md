# annsjon-spa

Simple SPA for annsjon.org

## Background

The idea was to create a new website for [Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory](http://www.annsjon.org).
With a lot of static content and text heavy pages I wanted to build something fast and lightweight, simple and easy to update. Yet using technologies that supports modern development and scalability.
