# annsjon-spa
Simple SPA for annsjon.org

## Background
The idea was to create a new website for [Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory](http://www.annsjon.org).
With a lot of static content and text heavy pages I wanted to build something fast and lightweight, simple and easy to update. Yet using technologies that supports modern development and scalability.

## Technologies
- [Node] - npm
- [Webpack] - transpiling and bundling
- [Riot] - templating and routing
- [Markdown] - "page" content
- [LESS] - [BEM] standard
- [Skeleton] - Responsive boilerplate
