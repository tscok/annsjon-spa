### Watcher's Guide

In mid May, or some week before that, if spring is early, the season for birds begin at Lake Ånnsjön. The ice on the lake breaks open at river outlets and the snow on mires starts to melt away. Ducks and waders soon arrive and in about two weeks time all birds have returned. Artic Tern and Red-necked Phalarope being the last.

During the first half of June activity peaks. Warbling Whimbrels and Reeves on the mires and on the lake; Red- and Black-throated Loon, Velvet Scoter, Common Scoter, Eurasian Wigeon, Tufted Duck, Greater Scaup, among other waterfowl.

Already by the end of June the activity around the lake is slowing down. Even so, for the interested a good part of July can be worth while a visit to the lake and surrounding mires and mountains.
