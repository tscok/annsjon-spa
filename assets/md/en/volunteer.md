### Volunteer

The long-term goal of our observatory is to document the existing bird populations and their fluctuations in our study area as well as possible, given available resources. This information may be used for many purposes, e.g. environmental protection or climate research. We try to combine rigorous scientific work with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all our volunteers.

We need volunteers from June 1 to August 31, and some years in May and September too. The best time for census work and general bird watching is mid-June. For mist netting and ringing, July and August. The peak season for ringing is the last two weeks in July and the first two weeks in August. During this time we try to run ringing at two sites in parallel.

Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory is a non-profit organization run entirely by volunteers. No salaries are paid. In some specific projects, we may have an opportunity to reimburse expenses such as train tickets. Accommodation is free for all volunteers.
