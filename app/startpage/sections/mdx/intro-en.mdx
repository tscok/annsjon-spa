#### Briefly about us

Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory is a non-profit association whose goal is to increase knowledge about bird life in western Jämtland.

Each summer we survey the presence of seabirds and waders on marshes, wetlands and mountains. We ring passerines in Handöl and in the Enan delta.

Many people visit us to combine their interest in birds with a holiday trip to a unique environment.

Welcome to visit us this summer!
