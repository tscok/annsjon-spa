### Older observations

In Sweden's Nature booklets from 1943-1949 there are a number of reports on bird sightings from different corners of the country. Several reporters were in Jämtland and i.a. is there information about Great snipe:

> [...] nested [...] at Offerdal in Jämtland (R. Wredhammar, 1944)

> Two nest finds are reported from Jämtland (K. von Essen, R. Wredhammar, 1945)

> The Great snipe has also appeared at Offerdal in Jämtland this year, and the species also occurs at Ansättfjället, where its breeding grounds were found (R. Wredhammar, 1946)

> In Jämtland, the Great snipe has been found nesting in the area of ​​Storlien (E. Sjökvist) and at Autovillenbuona a pair was observed in June (K. von Essen, J. Lund and Kai Curry Lindahl) [...] Jämtland hosts most of the known breeding sites, which however, can be counted on the fingers of just one hand. (1947)

[Anders Eriksson] _I intend to make sure that these booklets and perhaps some other excerpts from old printed matter sooner or later end up with the local report committee in Jämtland or at the bird station. There may also be some observations of older dates in the report committee's material that may be useful. For example. I remember that Håkan Billing found a nest somewhere near Sandknölarna in Hotagsfjällen in the 70's. In 2001, Tomas Bergström found a snipe nest somewhere too._

#### Timing and Methodology

[Anders Eriksson] _I experienced the lek at Storulvån fine one night a number of years ago (maybe 1992, can check my notes if needed)._

_The situation was special with a late snow melt. If I remember correctly it was one of the first days of June but the snow was still over large parts of the mountains. Went (water!) skiing along the trail and further up the east slope above the playground while waiting for the appropriate time. The evening and night then became very successful with nice observations of the game._

_What, in retrospect, I think might be interesting is that the late snowmelt made the search much easier than otherwise. The sloping bog where the snipe played lacked snow (perhaps due to the moving water in the bog) while the surrounding area was covered with snow._

_My conclusion is that vegetation maps together with observations of current snow conditions can provide good guidance as to where game may be found. Martin Tjernberg did a research effort in the 80s, but I assume you already know that. He probably has valuable views on methodology, etc._
