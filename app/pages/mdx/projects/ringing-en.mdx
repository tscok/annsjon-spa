## Ringing

Every summer since 1988 we have carried out standardized ringing of passerines in Handöl and Enan's delta in Ånnsjön.

Our ringing project stretches from July to September, where peak season is mid July to mid August. During this time, given adequate personnel resources, we try to ring at two sites in parallel.

The long-term goal is to document existing populations and their fluctuations in our study area. We aim to follow a large number of species and to measure the nesting success rates of e.g. Willow Warbler, Bluethroat, Yellow Wagtail, Brambling and Reed Bunting.
