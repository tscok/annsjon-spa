## Ringing

Every summer since 1988 we have carried out standardized ringing of passerines in Handöl and Enan's delta in Ånnsjön.

Our ringing project stretches from July to September, where peak season is mid July to mid August. During this time, given adequate personnel resources, we try to ring at two sites in parallel.

The long-term goal is to document existing populations and their fluctuations in our study area. We aim to follow a large number of species and to measure the nesting success rates of e.g. Willow Warbler, Bluethroat, Yellow Wagtail, Brambling and Reed Bunting.

### Volunteer

As a ringer, you have your own license, assistant license or extensive experience in ringing at a bird observatory or equivalent.

Assistants do not need to have previous experience in mist netting and ringing, but can only be accommodated during periods when we have at least one experienced ringer on site.

Well-coordinated groups of 2-4 ringers and assistants are especially welcome!
