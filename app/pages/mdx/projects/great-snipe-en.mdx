A weekend at the end of May (tentatively 21-24 May) this year's field work in the bird station's Great snipe program will be carried out.

This year, the following three sub-projects will be part of the programme:

1. Net capture of Great snipe on playgrounds in Handölsdalen. The main purpose is to provide some individuals with GPS loggers to be able to follow their local and global movements in detail. Possibly we also recapture individuals that have carried light logs since previous seasons. The sub-project is run by researchers from [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), and contributes to new knowledge about migration strategies and wintering sites for the Great snipe.
2. Radio bearing of females from late May to mid-June. The aim is to document places of residence in the vicinity of selected play sites. The sub-project contributes to new knowledge about the breeding biology of the population.
3. Inventory of known play sites and interesting areas at the end of May and beginning of June. The purpose is to document the activity on all active plays and, if possible, find new play locations. The sub-project contributes to the bird station's long-term population monitoring.

In all sub-projects there is an opportunity for motivated people to participate as an assistant!

### Volunteer

The Great snipe plays mainly at night, most intensively between 11pm and 2am. All inventory and net capture must therefore be done at night, and the days will be devoted to documentation, preparation and recovery. However, radio tracking can be done during the day.

Both inventory and radio bearing involve daily hikes of 5-25 km in partly unpaved mountain terrain. Good fitness and mountain experience make the work easier, and you must feel comfortable with a map and compass as well as GPS. Good hearing is a requirement.

### Background

The population of snipe is one of the most important reasons why Ånnsjön-Storlien is on BirdLife International's list of Important Bird Areas (IBA), i.e. areas of particular importance for the conservation of one or more bird species.

At the same time, the Great snipe is a species that, due to its special living habits, is not mapped by Ånnsjön's bird station's main project, marsh inventory and ring marking. However, the spawning behavior means that as soon as all spawning grounds are known, the species can be inventoried fairly efficiently. Today, we probably know most of the game locations in our area, but still find a new game every season.

Great snipe in Scandinavian mountain areas have been studied in detail by Swedish and Norwegian researchers for many years. The Swedish studies have mainly been conducted in Härjedalen, and experiences from there show that snipe prefer areas with plenty of earthworms in the soil, and open, tufted mountain slopes with occasional bushes. This matches well with our experiences from recent years. The vegetation type can be found on bedrock and vegetation maps, and covers very large areas in western Jämtland.

Searching for new gaming locations is usually very time- and staff-intensive. The inventories will be more effective if you choose areas where snipe have been reported, recently or long ago.
