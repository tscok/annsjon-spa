##### Mountain routes

Fifteen mountain routes in the Ånnsjön-Storlien area are inventoried annually using line assessment methodology. The aim is to follow the population development of species within the willow belt, the region just above the tree line. Primarily species with their distribution limited to this region are e.g. Long-tailed Duck, Dotterel, Purple Sandpiper, Dunlin, Long-tailed Skua, Ptarmigan, Willow Grouse, Rough-legged Buzzard, Raven, Wheatear, Snow Bunting, Lapland Bunting and Ring Ouzel.

Inventorying mountain routes is very easy, as long as you can read the map!

##### Grid survey

This is a semi-quantitative bird inventory of a grid, where each square is 1x1 km. The grid corresponds to a national coordinate system, a black grid you can see embedded in most topographical maps. Semi-quantitative means it is primarily the occurrence of species that are noted, while the number of individuals is secondary.

##### Mire survey

A dozen or so bogs and wetlands around Lake Ånnsjön and Storlien have been inventoried every summer since 1989. All waders, ducks, gulls and other wetland birds as well as some terns are noted. Wood Sandpipers, Whimbrels and Arctic Terns are common species on the marshes, and you have a good chance of finding Broad-billed Sandpipers in the wettest areas.

##### Lake survey

Ånnsjön is inventoried by boat on one or more occasions to note e.g. loons, scoters, ducks and other seabirds that are nesting or resting on their way up to still frozen mountain lakes. A teamwork for three people where one drives the boat, one scouts and identifies and one takes notes.
