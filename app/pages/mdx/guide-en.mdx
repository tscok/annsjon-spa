## Watcher's Guide

In the middle of May, or a week before that if spring is early, the actual bird season starts at Ånnsjön. The ice begins to break up at estuaries and bogs are becoming snow-free. Mallards and waders arrive gradually and in about two weeks all the birds are there with Arctic Tern and Red-necked Phalarope among the last arrivals.

During the first half of June, the activity is at its peak with singing Whimbrels and Ruffs playing on the bogs. On the lake are Red-throated Loon, Black-throated Loon, Velvet Scoter, Common Scoter, Eurasian Wigeon, Tufted Duck, Greater Scaup and other seabirds.

Already after midsummer, bird life slows down, but still during July and until mid-August, the lake with surrounding marsh areas and mountains can be well worth a visit for bird watchers.
