## Late Summer Week ‚òÄÔ∏èüçÇ

<CalendarDates from="2024-08-24" to="2024-09-02" withIcon />

**Only for members of the association.**

Welcome to Hand√∂l, late August to early September!

We spend the week ringing, cleaning nesting boxes, perform light maintenance work and planning for the future. We will also have time for some bird watching in the surroundings.

We stay at the bird station and cook together. Maximum 7 participants. We give priority to those who can stay the whole week, but depending on space, it is also possible to stay for a few days.

For more information and registration, contact info@annsjon.org.
