### FAQ

##### Where is Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory?

The Observatory is situated in the tiny village Handöl in the province Jämtland in mid-western Sweden, not far from the Norwegian border. Approximate coordinates are 63°15’N 12°27’E. You will find the Observatory premises just next to the Handöl Inn and camping cottages in the center of the village.

##### What is the aim of the bird observatory?

The long-term goal for our observatory is to document the existing bird populations and their fluctuations in our study area as well as possible, given available resources. This information may be used for many purposes, e.g. environmental protection or climate research. We try to combine rigorous scientific work with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all our volunteers.

##### What is your field season?

Our field season is June, July, and August. In June we focus on various census projects, and in July and August we do mist netting and ringing (banding) of passerines. Some years, specific projects may start in May or extend into September.

##### What bird species do you ring?

We mainly ring small passerines such as Willow Warbler, Reed bunting, Brambling, Bluethroat, Siskin, Redpoll, and Yellow Wagtail. In our approx 100 nest boxes we ring Pied Flycatcher, Great tit, and Blue tit. Occasionally we may ring exclusive species such as Tengmalm’s Owl in some of our large nest boxes or Red-necked Phalaropes in the delta, and in a specific project some 10-20 Great Snipes have been ringed annually in recent years.

##### When is the best time to visit Lake Ånnsjön?

For general bird watching the most vibrant time of the year is mid-June. At this time snow and ice is definitely gone from lower altitudes, and waders and passerines are displaying and singing most intensely. At higher altitudes, the breeding season is even more compressed and late June may be as good a choice.

##### When is the best time to participate in the activities at the Observatory?

We need volunteers from June 1 to August 31, and some years in May and September too. The best time for census work and general bird watching is mid-June. For mist netting and ringing, July and August. The peak season for ringing is the last two weeks in July and the first two weeks in August. During this time we try to run ringing at two sites in parallel.

##### How much do you pay?

Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory is a non-profit organization run entirely by volunteers. No salaries are paid. In some specific projects, we may have an opportunity to reimburse expenses such as train tickets. Accommodation is free for all volunteers.

#### Travel & directions

##### How do I travel to Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory?

We recommend train, see www.sj.se (available in English), from Stockholm or Gothenburg towards the ski resort Storlien. The nearest train stop is Enafors, about 7 km from Handöl. We usually arrange so that someone already present at the Observatory picks you up in Enafors by car.

By car you follow highway E14 from Sundsvall (330 km), Östersund (150 km) or Trondheim (130 km), and turn south in Enafors. Driving from Stockholm (670 km) is generally not recommended, but one viable alternative may be to go by train to Östersund or Åre and pick up a rental car for the remaining distance.

Last but not least, you can book a flight to Trondheim in Norway and then catch a train to Enafors, where we can arrange to pick you up.

#### Accommodation

##### What about lodging?

The Observatory offers free accomodation for all volunteers participating in our activities. We have four small bedrooms with two beds each, and a few more beds are available if needed. The Observatory building has a fully equipped kitchen (including fridge and freezer, electrical stove and oven, microwave ovens), and a bathroom with hot shower. There is a low-cost laundry facility in the village for long-term visitors. You need to bring your own towel(s) and bed sheets. Pillows and blankets are available.

##### What is the weather like in Handöl?

Handöl is situated in the Scandinavian mountain range, and the general climate is therefore rather cool (due to the altitude) and wet (due to the Atlantic rainfalls hitting the mountain range). The typical summer temperature is around 10°C, but may span 0°C – 25°C. Eastern high-pressure weather systems usually give hot and sunny weather for a couple of weeks every summer. Cold weather is most common in early June, and hot weather is most common in mid-July.

##### What do I need to bring?

Bed sheets and towel(s) are essential. High rubber boots are highly recommended for the census projects in June and are often useful during the ringing season as well, although ordinary hiking boots will do for most activities. A rain proof outer layer, long underpants, a hat, gloves, and a warm sweater are often needed at any time of the season. However, don’t forget to pack swimming gears in case the weather turns hot during your visit! And of course, bring your binoculars and other personal birding equipment.

##### What about eating and cooking?

We recommend that everyone staying at the Observatory at any given time coordinate eating and cooking. This is most practical given the available cooking facilities, and it is also more fun to cook and eat together! Coordinated cooking also facilitates the coordination of trips to the super-market in Storlien.

##### Is there a grocery store in Handöl?

The nearest grocery store is the super-market in Storlien, 25 km from Handöl. The only practical way to go there is by car. Usually there is at least one car available at the Observatory at any time. We will make some arrangement if this is not the case.

##### Is there a pub or restaurant nearby?

- Hanriis Café, open from early June to late September, serves coffee/tea and cakes.
- Enaforsholm Fjällgård, close to Enafors trainstation, has a restaurant open all year round. Book ahead for dinner reservations.
- During summer the tourist station Storulvån some 15 km up in the mountains is open, and is known to have a very good but somewhat pricy restaurant.
- In the village Storlien, 25 km away, there is a small restaurant and pub as well as a burger place by the train station.
- If you plan for a beer, please designate a driver for the trip back as Swedish drinking-and-driving laws are very strict!

#### Miscellaneous

##### What currency / cards are accepted in Sweden?

The official currency is still the Swedish crown (100 SEK ~ 9 Euro). Most shops and restaurants are happy to accept VISA or Mastercard, some may accept AmEx. The super-market in Storlien and some other local shops also accept the Norwegian crown (NOK) and Norwegian debit cards as most of its customers are Norwegians (who find the Swedish prices much lower). The nearest ATM is in Duved, 40 km east of Handöl.

##### How bad are the mosquitoes?

During the summer, the mountain region is well-known for having a lot of mosquitoes, which of course is fortunate for all insectivorous birds breeding here! To bird-watchers, the mosquitoes can be really annoying from time to time and cause itching and one or two sleepless nights, but are harmless in terms of diseases. We recommend the use of a common insect repellant, and long sleeves and trousers. Insect repellant in various forms are available at local stores, and the brand name “Mygga” (mosquito in Swedish) is a good buy. The mosquitoes appear around June 10, peak in early July and are largely gone in late August.

##### What other activities are available in the area?

The pristine mountain areas next to Lake Ånnsjön are very popular for hiking in both summer and winter. The tourist station Storulvån is the central starting point for many hiking tours as it is easily accessible by both train and car. Some 50 km east of Lake Ånnsjön is the major ski resort Åre, once a candidate city for the winter Olympics and in 2006 a successful host of the downhill skiing world championship.
