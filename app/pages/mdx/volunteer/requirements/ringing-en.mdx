As a ringer you have your own license, assistant license or extensive experience in ringing at a bird observatory or equivalent.

Assistants do not need previous experience in mist netting or ringing but can only be accommodated during periods when we have at least one experienced ringer on site.

Well-coordinated groups of 2-4 ringers and assistants are especially welcome!
