## Birdlife protection

The very special nature of the Scandinavian mountain range means that only a few highly specialized species manage to live and reproduce here. Even in the deciduous and coniferous forests close to the mountains, harsh conditions prevail at times, and many forest-dwelling bird species are here on the edge of their range. The birds here live both literally and figuratively on the margins and even small changes in the living conditions can have considerable consequences.

Lake Ånnsjön has been a Ramsar site since 1974, which means that, from an international perspective, there is a wetland area worth protecting. By signing the [Ramsar Convention](http://ramsar.org/), Sweden has committed to protect and preserve the birdlife in the area. Ånnsjön-Storlien is also one of about 70 IBA areas in Sweden. IBA stands for Important Bird Area, and is an international project run by [BirdLife International](http://birdlife.org/).

The fact that lake Ånnsjön is part of these two projects shows how valuable the area is, not only locally but also internationally. Lake Ånnsjön Bird Bbservatory's program for environmental monitoring means that we annually monitor the occurrence of some 60 bird species that breed in the area. We do this through recurring, standardized census projects, in bog and mountain environments, as well as catching and ringing small birds in deciduous forest and bush areas around Handöl, just west of Lake Ånnsjön.

The foundation for environmental protection is a well functioning system for monitoring population changes in animals and plants. After more than thirty years of research, we have started to get the basis that is necessary for us to be able to discover and follow long-term changes in the bird fauna. Short-term changes over one or a few years are common and usually depend on the weather. Long-term changes however can be due to environmental changes such as draining of wetlands, high grazing pressure, overgrowth of arable land and changed forestry. Other causes can be mercury poisoning, acidification or changed hunting pressure. The reasons can be found in the breeding area, the wintering area or in important resting places along the migration routes.

Among the bird species that we can reasonably monitor, half show no noticeable changes. This includes e.g. loons, most ducks, gulls, tits, chaffinch and sparrow. Canada geese, cranes, grebes, grebes, blue wagtails and grebes have increased. Species that have decreased are, e.g. heather piper, tufted whippet, common snipe, brushhane, garden warbler, black-and-white flycatcher and a few more long-migrating, insect-dependent warblers.

The causes are rarely obvious and observed changes must be analyzed and verified with complementary investigations. In the case of the insect-dependent seals, we believe that the reason is that the temperature during May was significantly lower in the late 90s than it was at the beginning.
