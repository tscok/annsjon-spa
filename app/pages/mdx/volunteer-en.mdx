## Volunteer

The long-term goal of our observatory is to document the existing bird populations and their fluctuations in our study area as well as possible, given available resources. This information may be used for many purposes, e.g. environmental protection or climate research. We strive to combine rigorous scientific work with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all our volunteers.

We are a non-profit association run entirely by volunteers. No salaries are paid but in some specific projects we may have an opportunity to reimburse expenses such as train tickets. Accommodation is free of charge for all volunteers. See our [FAQ](/volunteer/information) for more information.
