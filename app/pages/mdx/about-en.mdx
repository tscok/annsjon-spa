## About us

Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory is a non-profit organisation working for a better understanding about the birdlife in western Jämtland County. The lake and its surroundings are breeding grounds for species exclusive to the Scandinavian mountain range and includes Great snipe, Dotterel and Bluethroat.

Since we started, in 1988, bird enthusiasts from a great part of Europe have visted the observatory in Handöl, combining their interest for birds and a vacation in a unique environment. We have even attracted visitors from Australia and the Americas.

Each summer we conduct census projects around the lake to study the occurrence of seabirds and waders on mires, wetlands and mountains in the region. Close to the village of Handöl and in the Enan river delta we annually ring 2000-4000 passerines.

Combined the census and ringing projects allow us to follow some sixty species every year. Our survey area is the edge of the mountain range and changes to the spreading of many species are easily discovered in this marginal zone. Our collected data can be used to explain the effects of climate changes or for studying specific species.

The results are published in a yearly special edition of "Fåglar i Jämtland-Härjedalen" and continuously on this website.
