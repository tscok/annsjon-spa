## Projects

Lake Ånnsjön Bird Observatory studies bird life in western Jämtland. The purpose is environmental monitoring, documentation of climate change and basic ecological research.

We have divided tasks into a number of projects, each of which includes one to a couple of weeks of fieldwork. In addition to the standard projects, we also carry out nest box projects, given adequate personnel resources.
