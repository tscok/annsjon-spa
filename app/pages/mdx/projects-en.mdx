## Projects

In addition to the standard projects below, we also carry out nesting projects if the availability of personnel is good.

#### Great snipe project

The population of Great snipe is one of the most important reasons why Ånnsjön-Storlien is on BirdLife International's list of Important Bird Areas (IBA). Since 2004, together with researchers from Lund, we have carried out inventory, radio tracking and net capture as well as marking with light loggers. [Read more](/projects/great-snipe)

Since the start in 1988, we have carried out standardized ringing of seals in Handöl and Enan's delta in Ånnsjön. The aim is to follow population changes for a large number of species, and above all the project provides a good measure of the nesting success of e.g.

#### Mountain routes

Fifteen mountain routes in the Ånnsjön-Storlien area are inventoried annually using line pricing methodology. The aim is to follow the population development of bird species within the willow belt and the Kalffjäll region, primarily species with their distribution limited to this region, e.g. white-tailed godwit, pied piper, sandpiper, shrike, grebe, black grouse, black grouse, buzzard, raven, stone sparrow, snow sparrow, lapwing, and ring thrush Inventorying mountain routes is very easy, as long as you can read the map!

#### "The square"

The square box is a semi-quantitative bird inventory of a square area with a size of 1x1 km. The inventory grids correspond to the "Grid of the Realm", the black grid embedded in most topographical maps. By semi-quantitative it is meant that it is mainly the occurrence of the species that is to be noted, the number of individuals is noted only to a limited extent.

#### Mire census

A dozen or so bogs and wetlands around Lake Ånnsjön and Storlien have been inventoried every summer since 1989. All waders, ducks, gulls and other wetland birds as well as some terns are noted. Green legs, little sparrows and silver terns are common species on the marshes, and you have a good chance of finding sandpipers on the wettest parts.

#### Lake census

Ånnsjön is inventoried from a boat on one or more occasions to note e.g. loons, sea eagles, blackbirds, alfalfas and other seabirds that nest in the lake or rest on their way up to the still-frozen mountain lakes. A teamwork for three people where one drives the boat, one scouts and identifies and one takes notes.
