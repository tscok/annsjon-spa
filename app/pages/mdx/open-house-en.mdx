## Open House

**22.00 pm – 01.00 am, Night excursion to Great snipe lek**\
By far the greatest bird attraction in an international perspective is the playing Great snipe. It is one of the strangest things you can experience from a birder's point of view. Don't miss the opportunity to be guided to the right vantage point. A worthy end to a content-rich day. Pre-registration and information, Thomas Holmberg <Phone tel="073 - 058 36 30" />. We gather in the car parking at Enaforsholm at 10 pm for joint departure towards the Great snipe lek. The playground is located about 2.5 kilometers up the mountain, so put on your hiking boots!
