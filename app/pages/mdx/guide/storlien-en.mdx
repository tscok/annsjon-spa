## Storlien

This ancient ski metropolis has a lot to offer the bird watcher. About a mile east of Storlien on the south side of the railway there is a footbridge with two observation hides and a windbreak. They are located in a small wetland area in connection to Storlien's sewage treatment plant. The wetland birds are largely same as in Ånn. Broad-billed sandpiper sometimes occur on the bog that can be viewed from the windbreak. Bluethroat has a reliable occurrence in birch and willow thickets in the edges of the wetland area. The whole area is a bird protection area and may only be viewed from marked joints.

For those interested in birds, Storlien is best known for the Great snipe lek located on Skurdalshöjden. It is easiest to reach if you follow the lift street (Bånggårdsliften) which starts from the back of Hotel Högfjäll. From the penultimate lift pole turn left, upwards the slope. The lek is located 200-300 meters from the lift street about halfway between this lift and another lift that ends at about the same level due west. Listen carefully as you approach. The faint sounds from the lek is heard only about one hundred meters.

The birds are mainly active during the night and before 11 pm it does not make much sense to be in place. There is a hiding place on the site, but it works more like a rest cabin than as an observation hide, as the birds rarely play in front of the hide. Other parts of the low mountain Skurdalshöjden are also of ornithological interest. The area between Vindarnas tempel and Åhlénstugan can usually offer Lapland bunting, Bluethroat, Long-tailed skua and Dunlin.
