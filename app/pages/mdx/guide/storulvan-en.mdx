## Storulvån

If you want to go up in the mountains, Storulvån and the road to Storulvån are suitable starting points. Closest to Storulvån is Getryggen, which is easy to reach even if the steep climb can be palpable. Ptarmigan, Willow grouse and Bluethroat are common in the area, and at higher altitudes Dotterel and Snow bunting. Golden eagle is sometimes seen at Storulvån, but Rough-legged buzzard and Merlin are much more common.

A slightly longer but easier route is to walk to Ulvåtjärn, about 6 km from Storulvån along the trail towards Blåhammaren. At Ulvåtjärn Long-tailed skua is regularly seen and the slope up towards Storulvåfjället, just south of Ulvåtjärn, is usually a safe spot for Lapland bunting. If you continue the trail from Ulvåtjärn towards Blåhammaren, up a long climb, you reach a nice mountain plateau with a number of small ponds, like in a pearl band towards the mountain station, Blacktjärnarna. In and around these waters, ducks and waders such as Long-tailed duck, Purple sandpiper, Dunlin, Temminck's stint and Ringed plover are often seen. Ptarmigan and Long-tailed skua are other common species.

After about 3 km along the trail towards Sylarna, you reach the suspension bridge over Lill-Ulvån. South of the bridge you can follow the river some distance to the southwest. After 1-1.5 km you enter an area that all the way down to Spåime windbreak is rich in ponds and small wetlands surrounded by mountain heath and small hills. Red-necked phalarope can sometimes be found here. Long-tailed duck, Greater scaup, Common scoter can be seen, as well as many different waders. Whimbrel is a common sight while Dunlin is seen less often. Bluethroat, Lapland bunting and with a little luck Merlin. Short-eared owl or Rough-legged buzzard are other species to look out for, as well as Long-tailed skua, Ptarmigan and Willow grouse.
