#### When?

The Great snipe arrives in Ånnsjöfjällen in mid-May, and starts playing immediately. The playing goes on with high intensity some week into June. After that, most females are mated and the playing slows down. Occasional active males can, however, be heard in early July. Great snipes are nocturnal and plays mostly during the darkest hours of the night, approx. 11 pm – 2 am. Single stanzas can be heard already at 8-9 pm and some individuals continue playing until 4-5 am.

#### Where?

For those of you who want to enjoy the lek, we recommend visiting the top of the low mountain Högåsen, just north of Enafors. This lek is one of the biggest we know, with 20‑30 playing males. The playground is well suited for photography as it is free from shrubs, and the birds are often seen openly on the tufts. Högåsen also offers a nice panoramic view of the surrounding mountain world.

#### How?

You reach Högåsen via the paved _Blue trail_ which starts north of Enafors railway station. Alternatively, you step on the trail at the switchyard about 1 km northeast of Enafors (cross the large power line, find blue markings under the small power line). The blue trail ends at the rest cabin Grand Hotel at the top of Högåsen, after 2-3 km of moderate uphill. From the Grand Hotel cabin you walk 400 m due east. The playground is located on the easternmost part of Högåsen's top plateau.

**Remember! Be considerate of both Great snipes and other bird watchers when you visit the lek.**

Occasional quiet visitors can get relatively close to the birds (about 20-30 m) during the most intense part, but earlier in the evening you should keep a greater distance (50–100 m) to the birds to allow them to gather without disturbance. Groups of spectators should also keep a greater distance so as not to hamper the lek. When we go on our excursions we do not bring forth more than eight spectators at a time.

#### Tips!

Take off a layer of clothes before you start the walk up to Grand Hotel, then put it back on as soon as you get up.
Feel free to bring a seat pad or equivalent and sit down when you have located the playing birds. If you are lucky, the birds will gradually come closer.
