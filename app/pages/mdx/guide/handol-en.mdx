## Handöl

Handöl is located just west of Ånnsjön and is separated from the lake by Enan and Handölan's joint delta area. Park at former Pensionat Handöl or at Lake Ånnsjön's Bird Observatory, the base for the ongoing scientific investigations of bird life in the area.

The Observatory building, at the edge of Lomtjärnsmyren, is equipped with a platform on the roof which is open to the public. Tube binoculars are good to have here. The birds are about same as in Ånn. There is also an information room that is open when the Observatory is staffed, normally from the beginning of June to the end of August.

Along the river Handölan's course through Handöl stretches a lush, deciduous forest dominated area with a rich bird life. Among others, Garden warbler, Blackcap, Icterine warbler and Brambling breed here. Greenish warbler have nested at least once in the 1990's and Little bunting have been heard. Lesser spotted woodpecker are seen regularly. During July and August we are conducting bird ringing in the area.

Lake Ånnsjön and the outer parts of the delta are difficult to reach from Handöl if you do not have a boat. For the birdwatcher, it matters less as the bird life does not differ significantly from what one can see in Ånn. From the road between Handöl and Bunnerviken, close to the soapstone factory, you have a nice view of the delta and the lake.
