## Ånn

From the train station there is a hiking trail down to the bogs by the lake. First stop is the Lagoon, a small pond, a so-called overflow drain with connection to the water treatment plant in Ånn. Previously, it was a safe haven for Phalarope, but unfortunately it's by no means safe to see Phalarope here anymore, probably due to decreased nutrient content. There is also a smaller platform with a view of a bay by Ånnsjön, Vallaviken, which extends towards Ånn. In the summer of 2005, a pair of Horned grebe nested very close to the platform. When you continue on, you first reach Nätaholmen, a large and solid bird tower by the lake, then follows in turn Dolparna, a combined tower and hiding place, and furthest south, Halsenmossen, a real bird tower again.

Most rewarding from a bird's point of view is without a doubt Dolparna, which is one for the Ånnsjö area typical bog with plenty of small tufts. Here Arctic tern and Black-headed gull nest, Ruff play on the tufts and Phalarope and ducks can usually be seen on the open water surfaces. Little gull has also nested in Dolparna In recent years.

From both Nätaholmen and Halsen you have a fantastic view of the lake and the bog. The birds are further away than at Dolparna and more scattered. Tube binoculars are good to use at these places. Red-throated loon, Black-throated loon, Common teal, Eurasian wigeon and Common scoter are among the species you can usually see on the lake. On the bogs by the lake, Curlew, Whimbrel, Golden plover, Wood sandpiper, Redshank and Yellow wagtail are character birds. Greenshank and Snipe can also be seen.

Ånnsjön should be enjoyed at a leisurely pace. Those who expect large numbers of birds and fast "check"'s risks being disappointed. Take your time at each stop, stay at least half an hour preferably an hour. The whole hike by Ånn then takes just over half a day. The one who is on transit and have time only for a short stop should in the first place go down to the lagoon and take a look at Vallaviken from the platform. If you have at least an hour or two a visit to Dolparrna is recommended. If you only go there, it is easiest to go down at FBU's course yard in the western part of the community Ånn. Signs are available.

Just a few kilometers from Ånn is Klocka, an idyllic little village on the edge of Lake Ånnsjön. On the fields in the village you can with a little luck see both Golden plover, Whimbrel and Ruff. At the lake shore there is a small rest area with lovely views of the lake. The occasional Common scoter and Greater scaup can usually be seen. Here you can also, as at Halsen, view those for Lake Ånnsjön special peat erosion slopes that occur when the bog meets the lake. Sand martin nests annually in the several meter high peat slopes.
